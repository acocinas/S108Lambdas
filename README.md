# 🚀 Java Lambdas - Practice Level 1

## 📌 Introduction
Lambdas in Java can be challenging at first, but once mastered, they become a powerful tool for writing cleaner and more efficient code.

This practice focuses exclusively on Java Lambdas and the Streams API (Java 8+).

## 📋 Exercises

### 🔹 Exercise 1: Filter Strings with 'o'
Given a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all the strings containing the letter 'o'. Print the result.

### 🔹 Exercise 2: Filter Strings with 'o' and More Than 5 Letters
Modify the previous method so that it returns only the strings containing 'o' and having more than 5 letters. Print the result.

### 🔹 Exercise 3: Print Months Using a Lambda
Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all elements using a lambda.

### 🔹 Exercise 4: Print Months Using Method Reference
Perform the same printing operation as in Exercise 3, but using method reference.

### 🔹 Exercise 5: Functional Interface - `getPiValue()`
Create a Functional Interface with a method called `getPiValue()` that returns a `double`. Instantiate the interface in the `main()` method and assign it the value `3.1415`. Invoke `getPiValue()` and print the result.

### 🔹 Exercise 6: Sort Strings by Length (Ascending)
Create a list containing both numbers and text. Sort the list so that the text strings appear from shortest to longest.

### 🔹 Exercise 7: Sort Strings by Length (Descending)
Using the list from the previous exercise, now sort it in reverse order (longest to shortest).

### 🔹 Exercise 8: Functional Interface - `reverse()`
Create a Functional Interface containing a method called `reverse()`, which receives and returns a `String`. In the `main()` method, implement the interface using a lambda that reverses the given string. Test it by passing a string and verifying the result.
